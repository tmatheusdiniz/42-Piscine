## About

The 42 Piscine is an intensive 26 days program that exposes participants to the school's teaching methods. The focus is on peer-to-peer learning, so that participants can exchange knowledge and evaluate each other, thus learning from mistakes and successes. The whole process is very intense, allowing the piscinners to acquire various skills!
